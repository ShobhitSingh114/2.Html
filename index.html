                    if top tab not exists then open in _self. 

        rel : 
            noopener = When you open a link in a new tab or window (target="_blank"), using rel="noopener" prevents 
            the new page from controlling the referring page, thus mitigating security risks such as phishing attacks.

            noreferrer = The noreferrer value prevents the browser from sending the Referer header to the new page. 
                            This means the new page will not know where the link originated from.

            nofollow = The nofollow value tells search engines not to follow the link.

            bookmark = This can be used for links to important articles, posts, or resources that users might 
                        want to save or bookmark for future reference.
            ex: <a href="https://example.com/article" rel="bookmark">Bookmark this article</a>
